RENAL ULTRASOUND: Study is limited due to patient cooperativity. 
No gross abnormality seen in the right renal bed. The left 
kidney measures 9.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. There is a 
small cyst in the mid-to-lower pole measuring up to 14 mm. There 
is no overt solid mass. Probable extrarenal pelvis. No 
hydronephrosis.
.
CHEST PORTABLE [**2575-4-24**] 2:02 AM
FINDINGS: Placement of right internal jugular venous catheter is 
identified in the expected region of the mid SVC. No pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax identified. Again noted is airspace 
opacity within the right lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal placement of right internal jugular venous catheter 
without pneumothorax identified.
2. Right lower lobe pneumonia as described previously. 
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of dementia, cad, 
diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency who presented 
with mental status change, work up remarkable for HONK, 
hypernatremia, pneumonia, UTI.  

1)Mental Status change:
Multifactorial in secondary to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, 
pneumonia, metabolic derangements. The patient's mental status 
returned to baseline once metabolic derangements and infections 
were treated.

2)Endocrine: 
The patient has an unclear history of DM, but not presently on 
medications. Hyperosmolar state (HONK) likely precipitated by 
pneumonia/UTI. He was given aggressive fluids with NS initially, 
then changed to D5W since hypernatremia was not improving. 
Briefly required an Insulin drip, added D5 when sugar <200, 
converted to long-acting insulin on [**4-24**]. He was tapered to 
standing NPH insulin, then later became hypoglycemic with 
treatment of his infection. He was discharged on Humalog sliding 
scale. Treatment with an oral antidiabetic [**Doctor Last Name 11**] should be 
considered as an outpatient as Pt's Hgb A1C was 7.5 on 
admission.
  
4)Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: 
Pt is s/p L nephrectomy. Likely secondary to ATN in setting of 
hypotension, hypovolemia. Pt's baseline Creatinine is 1.9 
according to PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7009**] improved from 3.8 to 3.0 with IV 
fluids, but was in plateau phase for several days. Renal service 
was consulted, renal ultrasound did not reveal hydroureter. 
Gentle intravenous fluids continued to improved pt's Cr 
clearance leading up until discharge. His medications were 
renally dosed. 
  
5) Heme: 
Anemia consistent with AKD in combination with chronic kidney 
disease. Guaiac negative. Renal recommended starting EPO q 
M,W,F. Hematocrit was stable on serial checks.

6) Infectious Disease: 
a) Pneumonia: required ICU admission  
--vancomycin, ceftriaxone, levoquin initially - was changed to 
vanc/zosyn on [**4-24**] for a health care associated pneumonia. He 
should complete a full 14 day course of Vancomycin as his sputum 
grew MRSA.
b) UTI--grew cipro and bactrim resistant E. Coli- 14 day course 
of ceftriaxone for complicated UTI
c) Diarrhea- Pt developed copius diarrhea on HD #4, was started 
on empiric Flagyl PO, C. diff x 2 negative. His stools 
normalized following initiation of treatment. He should complete 
a 14 day course following the last day of Vancomycin and 
Ceftriaxone.
  
7) Suprapubic Catheter:
Pt was noted to have copious urine drainage from around his 
suprapubic catheter, without evidence for skin infection. 
Urology was consulted and recommended Tolteridine 1mg BID for 
potential bladder spasm. He has a 24 Fr foley. There is no 
further role for intervention except for continued monitoring to 
assure his catheter flushed, dressed properly for good position 
within the bladder.

8) Speech and Swallowing evaluation:
Recommended PO diet of soft solids with thin liquids, pills 
crushed as allowable. 
Aspiration precautions with 1:1 assist at meals.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 556**] 
Chief Complaint:
Shaking.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
Intubation
Foley
 
History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, colon cancer 
status post resection, and recent MI just discharged from 
[**Hospital 770**] Hospital on [**11-14**], who presented to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital 
early this morning with shaking and confusion.  History is 
mostly from the record as the patient is intubated and the wife 
is a poor historian.  Per the wife, she says he was doing well 
just after discharge, and was walking around as much as he 
could.  She says he has not drank alcohol since he got home.  
His only complaint has been profuse watery diarrhea, numerous 
times a day, both in the hospital, and since discharge.  
Otherwise he did not complain of chest pain, shortness of 
breath, abdominal pain, fevers, or chills, prior to the day of 
admission.

As mentioned above, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital 770**] 
Hospital from [**11-8**] to [**11-14**] after presenting with shaking.  He 
was found to have a cardiac enzymes leak, and underwent p-MIBI 
on [**11-13**] that demonstrated transient ischemic dilatation of the 
LV with a small to moderate sized region of ischemia involving 
the lateral wall, as well as a small to moderate fixed inferior 
defect with hypokinesis suggestive prior infarction.  EF 50%.  
No intervention was performed since he was in alcohol 
withdrawal, and asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, however 
plans were made for catheterization at [**Hospital1 25**] in the future.  He 
was discharged home on a prednisone taper for unclear reasons.

On arrival at [**Hospital 770**] Hospital on the morning of admission, 
vitals were T 104.3, HR 109, BP 116/59, 89% on 3L NC. His 
hypoxia progressed and he was intubated.  His blood pressure 
declined to the 70s systolic and he was started on 
norepinephrine via a left femoral line placed in their ED.  
Given concern for meningitis an LP was performed, demonstrating 
140 rbcs that cleared by tube 4, 2 WBC in tube 1, and 1 in tube 
4, total protein of 80, glucose of 100 (interpreted as 
negative).  Gram stain was without bacteria or WBCs.  Labs were 
notable for a leukopenia of 2.5, with 12% bands.  A UA had large 
leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite, [**5-14**] WBC, and moderate 
bacteria.  He received a dose of ceftriaxone 2 grams (prior to 
negative LP), vancomycin 1 gram, and flagyl 500 mg IV x 1 given 
concern for clostridium difficile (bandemia).  EKG demonstrated 
ST depressions in V4-V6. BNP 53, troponin I < 0.1 and CK 35.  He 
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 25**] ER because of lack of beds in the 
ICU at [**Hospital1 770**].  

Vitals in our ED were T 104.8, HR 101, BP 75/47, RR 32, 99% on 
ventilator (AC 550 x 20, 60%, PEEP 5).  He was continued on 
norepinephrine, given 2.5 L IVF, and sent to the MICU.
 
Past Medical History:
1) CAD; ?MI, ?3VD:  Patient presented to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital in 
early [**11-10**] with shaking and was noted to have a cardiac enzyme 
leak.  A p-MIBI revealed transient ischemic dilatation.  He was 
in alcohol withdrawal at the time, therefore he was started on 
ASA, Plavix, Statin, and sent home with plans for 
catheterization at [**Hospital1 25**] when able.  
2) Type 2 diabetes
3) BPH
4) Alcohol abuse:  Drinks [**1-6**] gallon of Whiskey a week, per 
wife.
5) Colon cancer status post resection, details unclear.

 
Social History:
Quit smoking 10 years ago, smoked heavily previously - wife says 
he does have 1 cigarette a week.  Drinks [**1-6**] gallon of whiskey 
per week.  Lives with his wife of 59 years.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, and recent MI 
just discharged from [**Hospital 770**] Hospital on Plavix on [**11-14**] with 
steroid taper, who presented to [**Hospital 770**] Hospital early this 
morning with shaking, confusion, and profuse diarrhea, found to 
have significant bandemia, sepsis requiring norepinephrine, as 
well as perihilar infiltrates and hypoxic respiratory failure 
requiring intubation.

1) Sepsis:  Most likely sources were initially thought to be C. 
Difficile and pneumonia, both nosocomially acquired.  He was 
treated initially with vancomycin and zosyn (to cover nosocomial 
pneumonia), and flagyl empirically for C. Difficile.  
Subsequently, however, a blood culture from [**Hospital 770**] Hospital 
returned with E. Coli, and his urine culture from [**Hospital1 25**] also 
grew out E. Coli.  He was therefore ultimately felt to have 
urosepsis.  Vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued, while zosyn 
was continued.  He was weaned off of norepinephrine within 24 
hours.  He had been started on stress dose steroids on admission 
given that he had been on steroids for at least the last few 
days prior to admission (prednisone 30), however these were 
quickly tapered off.

2) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Most likely secondary to an 
early acute lung injury, which is compatible with his bilateral 
perihilar infiltrates.  His ventilator settings were rapidly 
weaned, and he was extubated 48 hours after arrival without 
difficulty.  Unfortunately the patient had to be reintubated due 
to aggitation and was on the ventilation for 5 more days.  He 
was then weaned off the vent and extubated.  At this point his 
family made the patient DNR/DNI.  The patient tolerated 
face-mask oxygen delivery for 3 days and then again developed 
respiratory distress and passed due to respiratory failure

3) Cardiac enzyme elevation, CAD:  Cardiac enzymes were trended 
and flat, and EKG was without changes concerning for an acute 
process.  He was continued on ASA, Plavix, and statin.  
Cardiology followed the patient but he was not a candidate for 
catheterization due to his poor prognosis otherwise.

4) Acute renal failure:  Almost certainly pre-renal in the 
setting of sepsis and hypotension, and improved with rehydration 
to 1.4, which is likely his baseline.  

5) Alcohol abuse:  Per wife, he hadn't drank in over a week 
prior to admission.  He did not exhibit any signs of withdrawal.

6) DM:  He had finger sticks QID, with an insulin sliding scale. 
 Glyburide was held.

7) FEN:  He had a diabetic, cardiac diet.

8) Prophylaxis:  He was given SQ heparin, PPI.

9) Access:  He arrived with a left femoral line that was removed 
in exchange for an IJ central line.  This, too, was removed once 
he no longer had a pressor requirement.

10) Contact:  Wife, [**Last Name (un) **] [**Known patient lastname 9274**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9275**].

Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 246**] 
Chief Complaint:
failure to thrive, hypotension  

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement

 
History of Present Illness:
History obtained from granddaughter and available medical 
records.  
98M assisted living resident with DM, multiple recent admissions 
to [**Hospital1 717**] (apparently s/p falls, UTI) who was just d/ced from [**Hospital1 717**] 
2d PTA (reportedly after he refused to go to rehab/NH) who was 
send to [**Hospital1 19**] with "failure to thrive" after being found 
lethargic, weak, and confused in his apt by visiting 'Elder 
services' so EMS was called & brought pt to ED ([**Hospital1 717**] on divert).  

.
Pt reportedly found sleeping on the (carpeted) floor of his apt 
yesterday but w/o obvious signs of a fall.  
.
Pt denies pain but is otherwise unable to give any history. Pt's 
granddaughter spend much of yesterday w/the pt & states that he 
did not have any complaints at that time. Pt has apparently had 
very limited mobility since d/c from [**Hospital1 717**] due to weakness.  
.
In ED, pt's SBP was initially stable in 128/52 but after a few 
hours, BP was noted to be 66/43 so pt started on dopa and 
L-subclav placed. Pt rec'd ASA 600 PR, ceftriaxone 1g, flagyl 
500, and hydrocort 100. Pt's BP improved with 3L NS and dopa was 
weaned to lowest dose upon transfer to MICU.  

 
 
Past Medical History:
hypothyroidism
dementia
prolactinoma
diabetes
s/p multiple falls
 
Social History:
lives at assisted living. Per pt's granddaughter, the pt's 
primary caregiver has been the pt's daughter x many years but 
this daughter recently had an MI and stroke so is at a rehab 
facility.  

 

 
Family History:
non- contributory
 
Physical Exam:
-VS: Temp 96.3, HR 80-100, SBP 120s->60s->110s on low-dose dopa, 
O2 Sat 95-98% on 2-3L NC. CVP 11-12.  
-Gen: elderly M lying in stretcher asleep

erythematous rash in anterior chest  
-HEENT: OP dry, EOMI  
-Neck: JVD not appreciated  
-Heart: S1S2 RRR  
-Lungs: occasional coarse airway sounds bilat lower lobes; no 
crackles appreciated; fair air movement  
-Abdom: soft, NT, ND, NABS  
-Rectal: guaiac negative in ED

elongated. 
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. 
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include severe

Atelectasis is a less likely possibility. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
98M with DM, dementia, and apparently several recent admission 
to [**Hospital1 717**] for falls, UTI, FTT, now BIBA after being found 
lethargic, weak, & confused. In ED found to have likely PNA, 
became transiently hypotensive, stabilized after IVF.  Patient 
intially admitted to MICU.  Thought to have early sepsis (e.g., 
from PNA), vs. mucus plug. Doubt that he had large AMI leading 
to cardiogenic shock given physical exam and flat CKs, although 
patient did have troponin elevation.  This was thought to be 
from either a cardiac event or from sepsis in setting of ARF.  
He was continued on antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn).  A head CT in 
the ED was negative for a bleed but notable for large sellar 
mass (which per daughter is known & old). Old records were 
reviewed, and it was found that patient has known prolactinoma 
invading his sella space and rendering him panhypopit.  The 
patient most recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 718**], also Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 719**]; 
has also been seen at [**Hospital1 717**] Brain Tumor Center.  Apparently not a 
surgical candidate, currently on Dostinex for the tumor.  
Endocrine was consulted, and recommended stress dose steroids 
with taper.  He was continued on hydrocort IV and then 
eventually transistioned to oral prednisone, 5mg, daily, which 
he will remain on indefinitely.  His temperature also decreased 
overnight on two occasions to 92-93 degrees.  He remained 
hemodynamically stable with no other suggestions of sepsis or 
infections.  This temperature decrease was thought to be 
possibly related to his hypothyroidism or hypopituitarism from 
the prolactinoma, no clear etiology was found. 
After four day stay in the ICU, the patient was transferred to a 
medicine floor.  He was continued on antibiotics for pneumonia, 
completed a week course of Zosyn; then given oral Levaquin to 
complete three more days for total ten day course of treatment.  
His Levaquin was discontinued one day early for concern of 
prolonged QT interval seen on EKG.  He was weaned off oxygen and 
his blood pressured stabilized despite discontinuation of 
midodrine.  It was thought that given his cardiac function (an 
echo done on [**3-19**] showed depressed LV and RV function, 
hypokinesis) he could benefit from initiation of either a 
beta-blocker or ACE, however given his tenuous blood pressure, 
this was deferred for now.  His creatinine continued to improved 
to .8 from 1.6 at admission.   He was restarted on Zyprexa 2.5mg 
BID, which he had been on according to his most recent discharge 
summary from [**Hospital1 717**].  PT evaluated the patient and recommended 
further treatment at a rehab facility.  This was discussed with 
the patient and his family.
He diabetes was relatively well controlled with 14 units of 
Lantus daily and a Humalog sliding scale.  This was decreased to 
5 units of Lantus as his blood sugars were much lower once the 
high dose steroids were stopped.  It is recommended that if his 
blood sugars increased, wait at least 48 hours before further 
increasing his Lantus dose to avoid precipitating hypoglycemia.  
He was continued on his home dose of Levoxyl.  It is recommended 
that he follow-up at the [**Hospital 720**] clinic after his stay at rehab.
On the day prior to discharge, he became acutely hypoxic down to 
oxygen saturation of 88% on RA.  CXR and physical exam most 
suggestive of fluid overload and the patient had received IVF 
the day prior for lyte replacement and hypernatremia.  He 
responded well to IV lasix, with oxygen saturation improving to 
96%.  
He was maintained on sc heparin for DVT prophylaxis and 
tolerated a diabetic/low sodium diet well with aspiration 
precautions.
